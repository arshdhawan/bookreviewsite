        <h2>The Siege</h2>
        <h3>by Helen Dunmore</h3>
        <i><p><strong>Review:</strong> Called "elegantly, starkly beautiful" by The New York Times Book Review, The Siege is Helen Dunmore's masterpiece. Her canvas is monumental -- the Nazis' 1941 winter siege on Leningrad that killed six hundred thousand -- but her focus is heartrendingly intimate.

        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>by M. John Harrison</h3>
              <p><strong>Review:</strong>In M. John Harrison’s dangerously illuminating new novel, three quantum outlaws face a universe of their own creation, a universe where you make up the rules as you go along and break them just as fast, where there’s only one thing more mysterious than darkness.

        <h2> Nothing To Envy</h2>
        <h3>by Barbra Demick</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Nothing to Envy follows the lives of six North Koreans over fifteen years—a chaotic period that saw the death of Kim Il-sung, the unchallenged rise to power of his son Kim Jong-il, and the devastation of a far-ranging famine that killed one-fifth of the population.

        <h2>The Smartest Kid On The Earth</h2>
        <h3>by Chris Ware</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Chris Ware’s almost-autobiographical tale of a meek man and his familial foundering has been on my to-read list since it started winning a bunch of awards in 2001. I’m kind of glad I’m reading it now, because I’m not sure I would’ve had the emotional fortitude to survive it back then.</p>

        <h2>Outline</h2>
        <h3>by Rachel Cusk</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Rachel Cusk’s acclaimed trilogy out of order – first Kudos, then Transit, then Outline. I’m not sure whether the trilogy would have been improved by reading it in the correct order, but the fact that I read several other books between these, means that I struggle to remember what happened in the previous in the previous novel, so perhaps it wouldn’t be any different.</p>

        <h2>Fun Home</h2>
        <h3>Alison Bechdel</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Distant and exacting, Bruce Bechdel was an English teacher and director of the town funeral home, which Alison and her family referred to as the Fun Home. It was not until college that Alison, who had recently come out as a lesbian, discovered that her father was also gay. A few weeks after this revelation, he was dead, leaving a legacy of mystery for his daughter to resolve.</p>

        <h2>The Thousand Atoms Of Jacob DE Zoet</h2>
        <h3>by David Mitchell</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong>In a typical manoeuvre, an incidental character from his first book, Ghostwritten (1999), would become a major one in his third, Cloud Atlas (2004). His fourth novel, Black Swan Green (2006), though more conventionally autobiographical than either, was littered with recurrences from, and clues to, both – as if worlds, both real and fictional, were endlessly intersecting. </p>

        <h2>Train Dreams</h2>
        <h3>by Denis Jhonson</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong>his short novel is a dream: the kind you dip into, just for a drowsy second, yet wake from to find youself still immersed in a great epic--wounded by its sorrow, giddy with its marvels—all visited upon you in the blink of an eye. </p>

        <h2>The Buddha In The Attic</h2>
        <h3>by Julie Otsuka</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> We came over from Japan on boats to meet husbands in pictures. We work the fields of the wealthy white men in California, never having a moments rest. We bear the children who we hope will grow up to be just like us, but much better. And we are the ones that suffer when we’re taken away and put into camps.</p>

        <h2>The Tigers Wife</h2>
        <h3>by Tea Obreht</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> In the surreal and yet all-too-real opening scene of Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, the Nazis bomb Belgrade zoo, causing the panicked animals to run for their lives. And it is during this same raid that the tiger of Téa Obreht's debut novel escapes to the hills above the fictional village of Galina.</p>

        <h2>Salvage The Bones</h2>
        <h3>by Jesmyn Ward</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> The story follows a poor African-American family living in Mississippi in the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina. This family has such a lot to deal with. Told from the point of view of fifteen-year-old Esch, we’re soon in her world – a house on the outskirts of town which she shares with older brothers Skeetah and Randall, a much younger brother, Junior, and their alcohol-dependent father.</p>

        <h2>The Flame Throwers</h2>
        <h3>by Rachel Kushner</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> The Flamethrowers begins with a soldier in the Italian motorcycle squadron of World War I braining a German soldier, which initially seems unconnected to the rest of the book, set in the 1970s. Scores of pages later, we discover that the Italian soldier is the founder of a contemporary character’s family fortune. It’s a leap, but between here and there, if we’re patient, we find an astounding book. </p>
